A servlet is simply a class which responds to a particular type of network request - most commonly an HTTP request.<br>
A JSP is a text document which contains two types of text: static data and dynamic data. The static data can be expressed in any text-based format (like HTML, XML, SVG and WML).<br>

Both of them are Java technologies that used for developing web applications. This project is an MVC example with Servlets and JSP<br> 
In this project, servlet used as a controller, jsp as a view component, Java Bean class as a model.<br>
In this project, we have created 6 pages:<br>
- onyuz.jsp a page that gets input from the user.<br>
- search.java and detay.java a servlet that acts as a controller.<br>
- viewResults.jsp and detay.jsp files acts as view components.<br>
- web.xml file for mapping the servlet.
